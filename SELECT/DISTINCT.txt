// removes duplicate rows from a result set
SELECT DISTINCT column_1 FROM table_name;

// you can also select TWO values that both need to be distinct
// the combination of values will be used for evaluating the duplicate
SELECT DISTINCT column_1, column_2 FROM table_name;

// what if we want to remove duplicates, but get more than that one column?
// we will use the ON keyword
SELECT DISTINCT ON column_1, column_2 FROM table_name;

// it is best practice to use ORDER BY when using DISTINCT ON
SELECT DISTINCT ON column_1, column_2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column_1;
