Allows you to sort rows in ascending or descending order

// order results alphebatically by first_name, in descending order
SELECT first_name FROM customer ORDER BY first_name DESC;

// order results by last_name, and first_name
// if a users share a last_name, then it will sort alphebatically on first_name
SELECT last_name, first_name FROM customers
ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;

SELECT first_name FROM customers ORDER BY LENGTH(first_name);

ORDER BY with NULL

SELECT first_name FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name NULLS FIRST;

SELECT first_name FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name NULLS LAST;
