// you can change the name of the column you return

SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;

the `AS` keyword is actually optional the query below is the same as the one above

SELECT column_name alias_name FROM table_name;

Another example

SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name FROM table_name;
